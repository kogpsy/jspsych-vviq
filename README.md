# Vanilla JS Dev Toolchain Template

Including Webpack, Babel and Prettier.

## How to use

First, to be able to start development, install required dependencies:

```
$ yarn install
```

Then, to build a bundled version of your code, execute (your bundle will be created in the `build` directory):

```
$ yarn run build
```

Or run the dev-server to leverage live reload and the like:

```
$ yarn run dev-server
```
